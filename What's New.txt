WHAT'S NEW
-----------

Version 4.1 builds on ver 4.0 by adding:
* rotation -- the rotational axis will remain enabled after use

Version 4.4 incorporates limit switches!
Note: G28 currently works. The PNP GUI does not allow the sending of parameters
(i.e. G28 X) and will not send them, as indicated by the breakpoint in parseGcode()
not stopping the execution
Also, configuration parameters moved to params.h
Removed TX/RX pin definitions

Version 4.5 skipped...

Version 4.6 replaces REVB PCB pins with REVC pinout
