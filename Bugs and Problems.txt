BUGS AND PROBLEMS
PIC N PLACE REV 3.5
-----------------

* ONLY THING CHANGED SINCE LAST GOOD RUN:
in TMR0_interrupt(), 2 lines were added
couple comments in usb.c, usb.h removed
the #include "gcode.h" in usb.h removed
writeUSBstring changed to const char *


* Does the timer0 interrupt still break the code? Just added a line to clear the TMR0IF flag (sunday night)
but the interrupt is still disabled. need to try this.
* Check if the timing is actually correct
* Add the function specs/descriptions from PICnplace4.X
* Change the setupUSB() func so that it returns 1 if it worked, 0 if failed
